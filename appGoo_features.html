            <h2>Database persistence</h2>
            <p>You choose what is stored within the PostgreSQL database. Whilst it can work in conjunction with other server technologies such as Node.js and PHP, appGoo's application code is be stored and executed within the PostgreSQL database itself.</p>
            <p>Configuration determines where Javascript, CSS, fonts, documents and graphics are stored. They can all be in the filesystem or external to the application domain - appGoo caters for all scenrios.</p>
            <p>You can take advantage of storing data in a relational method or the document/NoSQL structure - or mix accordingly. PostgreSQL is feature rich and appGoo is compatible with any add-on of the database - therefore the capabilities of the application code that you create are only bound by what you can create in the database. You can even interact with the operating system to perform other functions (even though this would reduce the performance and defeat the purpose of executing within the database).</p>
            <p>The configuration and architecture of the database is independent of appGoo - therefore you can take advantage of its native features including replication and clustering. PostgreSQL can even be used as a gateway for storing data in other databases through <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/postgres-fdw.html">Foreign Data Wrappers</a> (FDWs). Currently, appGoo is only available on the PostgreSQL database - but <abbr title="Foreign Data Wrappers">FDWs</abbr> open the ability to store data elsewhere.
            <p>Note that appGoo should be completely compatible with <a href="http://www.postgis.net/"><abbr title="PostGIS is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects allowing location queries to be run in SQL">PostGIS</abbr></a> but is not yet tested. This will occur in the future. We do not see any reason why there would be an incompatability.</p><br>
            
            <h2>Language independent</h2>
            <p>This is not referring to the language of the web. It is expected that HTML5, Javascript and CSS is served to the browser. <a href="http://webassembly.org/" target="_blank"><abbr title="WebAssembly or wasm is a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web">WebAssembly</abbr></a> is not a capability of appGoo. Language independence refers to the ability to code PostgreSQL database functions in multiple languages. The main language - and we use this as our base language for developing applications is <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql.html" target="_blank">PL/pgSQL</a>. It is easy to learn and very powerful with SQL and JSON and extremely fast at most operations. Other languages that can be used to build functions are:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>C/C++</li>
            	<li>Java</li>
            	<li>Javascript/V8</li>
            	<li>LUA</>
            	<li>Perl</li>
            	<li>pgOpenCL (Open Compute Language for GPU processing)
            	<li>PHP</li>
            	<li>Python</li>
            	<li>R</li>
            	<li>Ruby</li>
            	<li>Scheme</li>
            	<li>Shell</li>
            	<li>TCL</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each language has its own disadvantages and advantages, and an application can consist of a mix of functions that are coded in different languages. For example, text manipulation might be performed via PL/Perl functions and all other functions are PL/pgSQL. It is whatever you are comfortable with. The multiple choices lower the barriers to entry and allow you to start with a language that you are comfortable with.</p><br>
            
            <h2>Framework/Library independent</h2>
            <p>This refers to Javascript frameworks and libraries. Providing the framework/library does not require a build step to generate the Javascript or other code, any framework or library can be used. appGoo does not read the Javascript, it passes it to the browser to process. What libraries and frameworks that this code references is of no concern to appGoo. For example, this page is built using Bootstrap and JQuery, there are sample pages that you can reference above that use AngularJS and React.</p>
            <p>It is entirely possible to use just vanilla Javascript - or no Javascript at all! It is at your discretion. This ensures that a wide variety of web projects can be developed using appGoo. Note that complications arising from code builds are not a barrier to using appGoo - merely state that Javascript is served from the filesystem rather than from within the database for these scenarios.</p>
            <p>CSS can be served either raw or compiled. CSS is loaded into the database or it is served from the filesystem. appGoo Core does not address how CSS and Javascript is loaded into the database - this is addressed by other appGoo components for application development. Regardless of how it is loaded into the database, appGoo will serve it if referenced.</p><br>
